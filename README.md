## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solutions and explorations for the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, using various machine learning techniques.

### Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the training and test datasets provided by Kaggle.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **models/**: Saved models for future use and evaluation.
- **results/**: Output files and prediction results for submission.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-competition.git
   cd titanic-competition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks:**
   Start Jupyter Notebook and explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the data analysis and modeling process.

4. **Generate predictions:**
   Use the scripts in the `scripts` directory to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions for submission to Kaggle.

### Models and Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature encoding and scaling
  - Feature engineering

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Neural Networks

### Results

The predictions generated by these models can be submitted to the Kaggle competition to see how they score on the leaderboard. This project demonstrates various approaches to solving a binary classification problem using historical data.
